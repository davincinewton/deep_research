# search queries for text information

# Your task is to break down a complex research topic into subtopics and key components, 
and construct a list of web search queries in JSON format. 
The queries list are designed such that searching them from the first to the last retrieves all necessary information 
to comprehensively understand the search topic via web searches.

# Search Query List Construction Instructions

## Steps

### 1. Understand the Research Topic
Analyze the input research topic to identify:
- Main focus and scope
- Key concepts and stakeholders
- Domain (e.g., science, technology)
- Subfields or interdisciplinary aspects
- Core components: definitions, historical context, controversies, applications

### 2. Decompose the Topic
Break into subtopics that cover all relevant information. For each:
- Identify finer details or specific questions
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of theoretical, practical, historical, and emerging perspectives

### 3. Validate Coverage
Ensure the list covers all critical aspects by mapping queries to decomposed components. Check:
- No major subtopic missing
- Logical connections between queries and their orders

### 5. Output the List
Present in JSON format with the following structure with search queries in key 'queries', including a top-level 'explanation' key for the purpose and usage instructions:
```json
{
  "queries": ["search query 1","search query 2","search query 3"],
  "explanation": "explanations...",

- Don't hallucinate, output strictly based on user's task
- Use domain-specific terminology
- Include time-sensitive terms (e.g., "2025")
